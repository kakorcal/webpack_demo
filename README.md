# Webpack Demo
Webpack configuration examples inspired by https://github.com/survivejs-demos/webpack-demo

This repo follows the Webpack e-book (highly recommend - http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/) from Juho Vepsäläinen, Tobias Koppers and Jesús Rodríguez Rodríguez. 

Each branch in this repo corresponds to a section in the book. For example, the starter branch includes the code covered in the 'Getting Starting' section along with my additional comments. This is intended educational purposes only.
